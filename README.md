# nRF5340 Eagle Reference Layout

This is a recreation of Nordic's reference layout for the nRF5340 in Eagle. The layout given by Nordic is in Altium, and it might be useful to those who do not have access to that software. While it's pin and pcb perfect replication, users should use with caution and validation since I am not Nordic.
