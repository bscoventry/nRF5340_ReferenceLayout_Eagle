# nRF5340 Eagle Reference Layout

This is a recreation of Nordic's reference layout for the nRF5340 in Eagle. The layout given by Nordic is in Altium, and it might be useful to those who do not have access to that software.

This can be easily ajdusted to other configurations by minor changes to reference schematic and board layout.
